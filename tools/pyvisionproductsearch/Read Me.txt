These files aren't a replacement for installing the pyvisionsearch package.
You have to install that package first and then replace __init__.py and ProductSearch.py with these versions.
Originally,
1. Google made an API called Vision Product Search
2. The creator of the AI fashion app made their own helper library (wrapper) to make it easier to work with Google's API
3. Google deprecated one of the packages that was used in the wrapper library
4. Someone else migrated the wrapper library to work again
5. I changed their code to fix the invalid gcs error inside AddReferenceImage
